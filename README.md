# ENS-Raidium Challenge 2024: CT Scan Image Analysis

## Project Overview
This repository contains my submission for the Raidium Challenge organized by École Normale Supérieure (ENS). The challenge focused on applying Deep Learning and Computer Vision techniques to analyze CT scanner images. 

I started from the notebook provided by the organizers, and I tried to improve the results by first trying to implement dummy algorithms and then implementing a U-Net model ! 

Have fun reading my notebook !
